# INTO THE VOID ðŸš€
My Project 3 Interactive jQuery Game! If you're on desktop you can use the left and right arrow keys. If you're on a device with a touch screen you can also play by tapping the left and right side of the screen to move the rocket!
Would love some feedback if you take the time to play or look at my code! :)
